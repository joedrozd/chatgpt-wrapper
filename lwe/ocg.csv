Help to Buy Remortgage – no capital raising ,"The following applies to Help to Buy schemes in England and Wales only. For Scotland click here.

We are able to consider a remortgage transaction where the property was originally purchased on any shared equity Help to Buy Scheme where the loan amount will be limited to the repayment of the existing mortgage secured on the property.

The Help to Buy Equity Loan: Monthly interest fee payments are payable on the Help to Buy Equity Loan after five years, which are in addition to the monthly repayments for the mortgage the customer takes with Precise Mortgages. As part of the Help to Buy Equity Loan scheme the monthly interest fee payments will initially be charged at a rate of 1.75% per annum and will increase by RPI +1% every year until fully repaid. To account for the annual rise in the payments on the Help to Buy Equity Loan, Precise Mortgages stresses this commitment by multiplying it by 125%. The Residential Calculator will do this automatically.

The Help to Buy Equity Loan should be added to the DIP in the ‘Applicant Commitments’ section as a loan. We require both the Help to Buy Equity Loan balance and the monthly interest fee payment amount to be entered.

The monthly interest fee payment on the Help to Buy Equity Loan must be calculated using Precise Mortgages’ Residential Calculator. To complete this information either the Help to Buy Equity Loan amount or the current Help to Buy Equity Loan monthly commitment is required, if this is already being paid.

As the Help to Buy agent needs to provide their approval of the remortgage, we need to be sure that this has been obtained before we proceed. We will not instruct our valuation until you have confirmed that the customer is happy to go ahead following our initial assessment. You should contact our processing team to confirm this by either calling 0330 1596001 or email new.build@precisemortgages.co.uk.

When submitting applications for Help to Buy remortgages it is the responsibility of the Intermediary to ensure that the application is eligible and compliant with the rules of the appropriate Help to Buy scheme before the submission is made.

If the Help to Buy Equity Loan is being repaid in full our standard residential criteria will apply and the application should be submitted on one of our core residential products and not as a Help to Buy application.

Part and Part – with this option the Capital and Interest method applies to one part of the mortgage and the Interest Only option applies to the other part. Each part of the loan (Interest Only and Capital and Interest) must be a minimum of £5,000.
