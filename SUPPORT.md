Some important things to note when seeking support for this project:

* **The maintainers are donating their time:** As such, they may not prioritize support requests over bugs and features. There are other developers and end users who also pitch in, and they do sometimes respond to support requests.
* **Consider paying for support:** If you're having any installation or usage issue not related to a bug, consider hiring a competent professional to assist you!
