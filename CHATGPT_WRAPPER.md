The original ChatGPT Wrapper project (created by [mmabrouk](https://github.com/mmabrouk)) has been removed from this project.

It became less useful after the release of [OpenAI's Chat Completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api), and also became harder to maintain due to security lockdowns on [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com).

Thus, the developers made the decision to retire it.
