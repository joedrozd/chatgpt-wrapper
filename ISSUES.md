This project is new and moving fast.

As such, things do break from time to time.

Before you report an issue:

* **Are you running the very lastest version of the code?**: It's possible the issue has already been fixed, so please update first and see if it's still happening.
* **Have you checked the issue queue for your issue?:** We recommend searching both open and closed issues to see if you can find an answer to the issue you're experiencing.

If none of that helped, then absolutely [file an issue](https://github.com/llm-workflow-engine/llm-workflow-engine/issues), and provide as much detail as you can -- more information will help us fix it faster!
